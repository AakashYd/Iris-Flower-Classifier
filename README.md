- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for Neural Networks)


## Description
This project presents a user-friendly, Python-based GUI application for the classification of Iris flowers. Developed using the Tkinter library, the app allows users to input flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and receive real-time classification results, identifying the Iris species as Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

### Key Features:
1. **Real-time Classification:** Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model from scikit-learn to classify Iris flowers based on user-provided measurements.
2. **User Interface:** Features a clean, intuitive GUI with Tkinter, designed to be easy to navigate for users of all technical levels.
3. **Data Scaling:** Incorporates StandardScaler to preprocess input data, ensuring accurate and consistent predictions.
4. **Model Training:** Includes a comprehensive model training setup with the Iris dataset, ensuring robust performance and reliability.

### Technical Specifications:
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries and Dependencies:**
  - Tkinter (for GUI)
  - scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - StandardScaler (for data scaling)
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)

### Usage Instructions:
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have all the required Python libraries installed.
2. **Run the Application:** Execute the script to launch the GUI.
3. **Input Measurements:** Enter the measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
4. **Classify:** Click the 'Classify Flower' button to get the prediction.
